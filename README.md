# Desolate Dungeon

This is a 2D sidescrolling combat platformer created using Godot 4. It features a dynamic main character, a variety of complex enemies, a boss room, 
 and original sprites and animations for all of them. A few complex mechanisms are implemented, such as a parry system and enemy-specific attacks.

Here's a little gameplay preview!
